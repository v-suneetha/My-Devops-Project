# My-Devops-Project
In this project we will build a simple Java-based REST API and a Python alert script, using tools like Git, Docker, Kubernetes (Minikube), and Jenkins. 
1. The Java application will manage simple data (e.g., tasks or messages) via REST endpoints, and
2. The Python script will periodically check the API and print an alert if it is down. 
3. We will keep all code in a Git repository and containerize each app with Docker. 
4. The Java app will be deployed on a local Kubernetes cluster (Minikube), and 
5. Jenkins will automate the build and deployment (CI/CD pipeline) of the Java app.
